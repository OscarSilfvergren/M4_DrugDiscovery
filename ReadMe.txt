All scripts, functions, models, and data used for the analysis is included in these files. Please run scripts through the script called "main" which ensures that all data and variables are loaded properly. Scripts have been created to make it easy to plot all figures used in article, see "PlotInvitroSystems.m", "PlotPharmacokineticTranslation.m" etc.
To be able to create a mex file you need a comparable complier (for example MinGW64 Compiler) and IQM toolbox installed. The script "LoadAll.m" will help you install IQMtools if you unzip folder and place the single "IQMtools" folder, that contains all IQM files, in your directory. Otherwise, please see attached map "IQMtools" and read the instructions listed to manually install.
To plot everything from the manuscript simply press "run" through the main script.

If needed, please contact Oscar.Silfvergren@liu.se for any questions.
